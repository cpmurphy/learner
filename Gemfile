gem 'sinatra', '>= 3.2' # Using a recent stable version
gem 'puma', '>= 5.0'    # A recommended server for Sinatra
gem 'pgn2' # Note: The user's app.rb uses 'pgn', but Gemfile has 'pgn2'. I will keep 'pgn2' as per Gemfile.
           # If app.rb is correct with 'pgn', this should be 'pgn'.
           # For the test, I've used 'pgn' as that's what app.rb uses for PGN.parse
gem 'json'              # Standard JSON library, Sinatra often includes it
gem 'minitest', '~> 5.0' # For testing
